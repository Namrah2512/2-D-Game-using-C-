# 2-D-Game-using-C-
We built this game using the concepts of Programming Fundamentals and OOP.
# Project Description:
Our project is a 2D game in which our hero/champion is defending his hometown from the Demon Lordâ€™s minions who are attacking and destroying his hometown. The Hero is fighting against the minions who are rampaging his hometown. Whenever the hero kills one of the minions of the demon lord, he is awarded 10 points.
# How to download the Game:
Due to large file size, I couldn't add the files in this repository. But worry not, you can still play the game! Go to my Github account: https://github.com/Namrah2512. Then, go to the Rise of the Hero repository and download the 'Website' folder. Open that folder, once downloaded. Open the index file. Go to download web page and click the download button. Unzip the folder and open the 'game1.sln' file.
# Note:
A wor document has been uploaded by me for whole detail of the project and in it are some screenshots of the game.
